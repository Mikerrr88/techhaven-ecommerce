# TechHaven - E-commerce Mockup Project

This project is a simple, client-side e-commerce mockup built using **Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. It serves as a final assignment demonstrating core web development concepts, including responsive design, client-side form validation, local storage for session management, and data filtering from a static JSON file.

## Features

| Feature | Description | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Responsive Design** | The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. | Achieved using CSS Flexbox and Media Queries in `css/style.css`. |
| **User Authentication** | Simulated login and signup functionality with client-side validation. | User data and session state are managed using the browser's `LocalStorage`. See [auth.md](docs/auth.md) for details. |
| **Product Search** | Allows users to filter products displayed on the `products.html` page. | Filters a static list of products loaded from `data/products.json` based on name, category, and description. See [search.md](docs/search.md) for details. |
| **Session Management** | The navigation bar dynamically updates to show "Login/Sign Up" or a "Hi, [Username]" message with a logout button. | Handled by checking the `currentUser` key in `LocalStorage`. |
